Hello Everyone,

Here is My Regression Project based on Predicting Price of Car using Linear Regression.

Dataset
I Used Car Selling Dataset which is one of the Dataset uploaded on Kaggle.

Link to the Dataset : Car Price Dataset

Problem Statement
To develop a Machine Learning Model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various features and attributes.

The predicted prices will assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions, ensuring fair transactions in the used car market.

Streamlit Web App :

For my Car Price Prediction Project, I have created a Streamlit Web App for predicting the prices of cars in more interactive and user friendly way.

This Web App allows you to predict the price of a car by just selecting some of its features and fill in some details.

Conclusion:

Developed a highly accurateRandomForestRegressor Model using various features and attributes to predict used car prices, achieving an average prediction accuracy of 96%.

Further Model showcased its robustness by undergoing rigorous DecisioTreeRegessor of 93%.
